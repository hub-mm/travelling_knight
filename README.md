cd travelling_knight
```

<strong>Edit main.rb content with which ever test you want:</strong> (caps or lowercase)
```
test.knight_moves(['F', 4], ['C', 8])
test.knight_moves(['h', 3], ['d', 2])
```

<strong>Start test:</strong>
```
ruby main.rb
```
It will output the shortest path and amount of moves taken.

Hope you enjoy.
